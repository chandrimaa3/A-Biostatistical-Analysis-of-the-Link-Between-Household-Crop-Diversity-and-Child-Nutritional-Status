# A Biostatistical Analysis of the Link Between Household Crop Diversity and Child Nutritional Status

This project explores the intricate relationship between food security indicators and nutritional outcomes using statistical and machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify key determinants influencing nutritional status and to assess how food availability, accessibility, and affordability contribute to overall public health.

## 📘 Overview

Food security and nutrition are closely linked with socioeconomic and environmental factors. This project leverages data analytics to understand patterns and correlations among variables such as income, dietary diversity, food consumption scores, and malnutrition rates.
The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building to generate data-driven insights and actionable findings.

## ⚙️ Features

+ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and standardizing data.

+ Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing trends in food security and nutritional metrics across different regions or population groups.

+ Statistical Modeling: Hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression modeling.

+ Machine Learning Models: Predictive analysis using algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Gradient Boosting.

+ Insight Generation: Identification of the most influential features driving nutritional outcomes.
